How to Use 100-matrix_mul.py
============================

This module provides a matrix multiplication function called ``matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)``.

Usage
=====
The function ``matrix_mul(...)`` returns a new matrix resulting from the multiplication of
``m_a`` and ``m_b``.

::

    >>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul
    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4],
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = m_a
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    [[7, 10], [15, 22]]

::

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2]]
    >>> m_b = [
    ... [3, 4],
    ... [5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    [[13, 16]]

The function also supports matrices with floating-point numbers.

::

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1.2, 5.5, 6.2],
    ... [4.66, 12.3, -9.2]
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = [
    ... [5.0, 3.3],
    ... [-2.9, 4.4],
    ... [7.2, 4.4]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    [[34.69, 55.44000000000001], [-78.61, 29.018000000000008]]

Integers and floats can be combined in the matrices.

::

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2.2, 3.3, 4],
    ... [5, 6, 7, 8.8],
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = [
    ... [1.1, 2, 3.3],
    ... [4.0, 5.5, 6],
    ... [7, 8, 9],
    ... [10.01, 11, 12.3]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    [[73.03999999999999, 84.5, 95.4], [166.58800000000002, 195.8, 223.74]]

At least two arguments must be provided; otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul()) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix_mul() missing 2 required positional arguments: 
    'm_a' and 'm_b'

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul()) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix_mul() missing 2 required positional arguments: 
    'm_a' and 'm_b'

ValueErrors
===========

If the matrices cannot be multiplied (i.e., the number of columns in ``m_a`` is not
equal to the number of rows in ``m_b``), a ValueError is raised.

::

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4],
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [2, 3],
    ... [4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: matrices m_a and m_b cannot be multiplied

The matrices ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` cannot be empty; otherwise, a ValueError
is raised.

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([], [[1, 2]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: matrix m_a cannot be empty

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: matrix m_b cannot be empty

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[]], []))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: matrix m_a cannot be empty

Invalid Matrices
================

The matrices ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` must be lists. If either of them is
not a list, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul("not a list", [[1, 2]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_a must be a list

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], "also not a list"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_b must be a list

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul("not a list", "also not a list"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_a must be a list

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul(None, None))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_a must be a list

The lists must be lists of lists, specifically.

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([1, 2], [[3, 4]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_a must be a list of lists

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [3, 4]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_b must be a list of lists

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([1, 2], [3, 4]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_a must be a list of lists

Moreover, the lists of lists must only contain integers or floats.

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, "non-number"]], [[3, 4]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_a should contain only integers or floats

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[{"a": 1}, 8.8]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_b should contain only integers or floats

::

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, "non-number"]], [[{"a": 1}, 8.8]]))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix m_a should contain only integers or floats

Finally, all rows in matrices ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` should have the same length;
otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: each row of matrix m_a should have the same size

::

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4]
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: each row of matrix m_b should have the same size

::

    >>> m_a = [
    ... [1, 2],
    ... [3, 4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> m_b = m_a
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: each row of matrix m_a should have the same size
